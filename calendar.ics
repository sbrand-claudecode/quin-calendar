 ctric allure\, and quiet disillusionment\, of coming of age in 1980s New Y
 ork City.\n\nSet against the backdrop of downtown Manhattan&rsquo\;s art s
 cene\, the novel follows Nina Jacobs\, a young woman newly arrived in the

 tists\, parties\, and possibility\, the excitement of reinvention gives wa

 for a thoughtful discussion of Weiner&rsquo\;s evocative portrait of self-
 discovery\, ambition\, and the price of wanting more.\n\n*This event is co

  affirm that homelessness is a solvable crisis when met with compassion\, 
 awareness\, and collective will.\n\n*This event is complimentary and reser

 3\n\nBookmark the date for a compelling conversation exploring Canticle\, 
 the luminous debut novel by Janet Rich Edwards set in thirteenth-century B
 ruges - a story of faith\, independence\, and love.\n\nAt sixteen\, Aleys 
 is serious\, stubborn\, and prone to religious visions. When her closest c
 ompanion abandons her for the monastery and her family promises her in mar
 riage to the calculating head of the weavers&rsquo\; guild\, she refuses t
 o accept the life chosen for her. Fleeing home\, she finds refuge among th
 e Beguines - an independent community of religious women who live and wors
 hip outside the authority of the Church.\n\nWithin this vibrant sisterhood
 \, Aleys discovers scholarship\, friendship\, and a new sense of purpose. 
 But as illicit translations of scripture circulate and reports of miracles
  spread\, the women&rsquo\;s autonomy draws dangerous scrutiny from Church
  authorities - forcing Aleys to confront the true cost of devotion\, love\
 , and sacrifice.\n\nJoin us for a thoughtful discussion of this richly ima
 gined historical novel and its stirring portrait of spiritual awakening an
 d female agency.\n\n*This event is complimentary and reserved for members 
 only. Light bites and refreshments will be served.
