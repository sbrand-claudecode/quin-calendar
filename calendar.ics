 RL: https://members.thequinhouse.com/events/170316\n\nBookmark the date fo
 r a compelling conversation exploring Gorgeous Excitement\, the dazzling d
 ebut novel by Cynthia Weiner that captures the electric allure\, and quiet
  disillusionment\, of coming of age in 1980s New York City.\n\nSet against
  the backdrop of downtown Manhattan’s art scene\, the novel follows Nina
  Jacobs\, a young woman newly arrived in the city and determined to remake
  herself amid a world of glamour\, excess\, and creative ambition. As Nina
  is drawn deeper into a seductive orbit of artists\, parties\, and possibi
 lity\, the excitement of reinvention gives way to reckoning\, forcing her 
 to confront the cost of desire\, identity\, and belonging.\n\nAt once vivi
 d and introspective\, Gorgeous Excitement explores the tension between asp
 iration and authenticity\, the intoxicating pull of youth\, and the moment
  when fantasy collides with reality. Join us for a thoughtful discussion o
 f Weiner’s evocative portrait of self-discovery\, ambition\, and the pri
 ce of wanting more.\n\n*This event is complimentary and reserved for membe
 rs only. Complimentary light bites and beverages will be served.
