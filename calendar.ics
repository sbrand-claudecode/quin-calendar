 \n\nBookmark the date for a compelling conversation exploring Gorgeous Exc
 itement\, the dazzling debut novel by Cynthia Weiner that captures the ele
 ctric allure\, and quiet disillusionment\, of coming of age in 1980s New Y
 ork City.\n\nSet against the backdrop of downtown Manhattan’s art scene\
 , the novel follows Nina Jacobs\, a young woman newly arrived in the city 
 and determined to remake herself amid a world of glamour\, excess\, and cr
 eative ambition. As Nina is drawn deeper into a seductive orbit of artists
 \, parties\, and possibility\, the excitement of reinvention gives way to 
 reckoning\, forcing her to confront the cost of desire\, identity\, and be
 longing.\n\nAt once vivid and introspective\, Gorgeous Excitement explores
  the tension between aspiration and authenticity\, the intoxicating pull o
 f youth\, and the moment when fantasy collides with reality. Join us for a
  thoughtful discussion of Weiner’s evocative portrait of self-discovery\
 , ambition\, and the price of wanting more.\n\n*This event is complimentar

 ter Walk\, a powerful call to action to help end homelessness in our city.

 s unhoused neighbors.\n\nMembers are encouraged to meet at The ’Quin for

 re walking together to Boston Common for the official program. The morning

 nce and service providers before the walk begins.\n\nWinter Walk is rooted
  in the belief that ending homelessness starts with ending stigma. By walk
 ing side by side\, housed and unhoused\, we amplify voices too often unhea

 sness is a solvable crisis when met with compassion\, awareness\, and coll
 ective will.\n\n*This event is complimentary and reserved for members only

 3\n\nBookmark the date for a compelling conversation exploring Canticle\, 
 the luminous debut novel by Janet Rich Edwards set in thirteenth-century B
 ruges - a story of faith\, independence\, and love.\n\nAt sixteen\, Aleys 
 is serious\, stubborn\, and prone to religious visions. When her closest c
 ompanion abandons her for the monastery and her family promises her in mar
 riage to the calculating head of the weavers’ guild\, she refuses to acc
 ept the life chosen for her. Fleeing home\, she finds refuge among the Beg
 uines - an independent community of religious women who live and worship o
 utside the authority of the Church.\n\nWithin this vibrant sisterhood\, Al
 eys discovers scholarship\, friendship\, and a new sense of purpose. But a
 s illicit translations of scripture circulate and reports of miracles spre
 ad\, the women’s autonomy draws dangerous scrutiny from Church authoriti
 es - forcing Aleys to confront the true cost of devotion\, love\, and sacr
 ifice.\n\nJoin us for a thoughtful discussion of this richly imagined hist
 orical novel and its stirring portrait of spiritual awakening and female a
 gency.\n\n*This event is complimentary and reserved for members only. Ligh
 t bites and refreshments will be served.
