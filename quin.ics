 rtier. Renowned for his classical sensibility and refined eye for elegance
  and form\, Hoyningen-Huene created some of the twentieth century’s most
  enduring photographic compositions. This special exhibition at The 'Quin 
 House\, on view from February 16th–April 5th\, invites members to celebr
 ate the lasting artistry and visual storytelling of a true pioneer in fash
 ion photography.\n\n*This event is complimentary and reserved for members
