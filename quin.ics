 cussion\nJoin us for the final chapter in the Longevity by Design series -
  a culminating conversation that brings the framework of the complete seri
 es by Dr. Rich Joseph into focus.\n\nIn this capstone session\, Dr. Joseph
  will present a practical approach to health management rooted in energy\,
  capacity\, and sustainable performance. Through this lens\, he will unpac
 k the rapidly expanding world of biohacking and “interventional wellness
 \,” distinguishing strategies that meaningfully enhance long-term health
  from those that generate cost\, complexity\, or distraction without real 
 impact.\n\nThe conversation will then move beyond optimization and technol
 ogy to explore the deeper\, often overlooked forces that shape longevity. 
 Joined by a special guest\, Dr. Joseph will close with a perspective that 
 challenges conventional thinking and reframes what it truly means to susta
 in health over time.\n\nDesigned as both a synthesis and a shift in perspe
 ctive\, this final session invites participants to leave not only informed
 —but fundamentally reoriented in how they understand longevity.\n\n*This
  event is offered at $35 per person\, plus tax\, to account for the buffet
  lunch offered throughout the program. Reserved for members only. Cancella
 tions made within 48 hours of the event or failure to attend will result i
